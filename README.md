       Heard melodies are sweet, but those unheard
              Are sweeter; therefore, ye soft pipes, play on;
       Not to the sensual ear, but, more endear'd,
              Pipe to the spirit ditties of no tone:

...

                When old age shall this generation waste,
                       Thou shalt remain, in midst of other woe
       Than ours, a friend to man, to whom thou say'st,
                "Beauty is truth, truth beauty,â€”that is all
                       Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know."
